# 🚢 What is Docker? 

Docker is a tool that helps us build, share, and run applications in a consistent environment — no matter where the app is running or what operating system it’s on.

## 🧠 Why Do We Need Docker?

Imagine this:  
You’ve created a Node.js application that requires **Node.js version 16** and **MongoDB version 4**. Now, you want your teammate to run the same app on their computer.

Without Docker, your teammate would have to manually install those exact versions of Node.js and MongoDB. But they might end up installing newer versions by mistake — and suddenly, your app starts throwing errors or crashes. Why? Because the app was tested with different versions of the dependencies.

This leads to one of the most common phrases in software development:

> _“It works on my machine!”_

To avoid these kinds of issues, we use Docker.

Docker ensures your app runs **the same way** on every machine by packaging everything it needs — the code, dependencies, runtime, and configuration — into one neat and isolated unit called a **container**.

## 🧱 Key Docker Concepts

There are two main components in Docker:

### 1. Docker Image
- A Docker image is like a **blueprint** of your application.
- It includes everything your app needs to run (OS, libraries, code, etc.).
- Think of it like a **class** in programming — it doesn’t run on its own, but it defines what a running container should look like.

### 2. Docker Container
- A container is a **running instance** of an image.
- It's similar to an **object** in programming — created from a class (image).
- Containers are what actually use your system’s resources like CPU and memory.

## ⚙️ Docker Advantages

- **Portable**: Runs anywhere — your machine, a teammate's, or a cloud server.
- **Lightweight**: Uses fewer system resources than full virtual machines.
- **Consistent**: Same environment across development, testing, and production.
