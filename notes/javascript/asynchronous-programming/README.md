ðŸš€ What is Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript?
-
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it executes one line of code at a time.

âœ… Example of Synchronous Code
javascript

```
1. let user = "John";
2. let greetings = Welcome! ${user};
3. console.log(greetings);
```
In the example above:

Line 1 executes first

Then line 2

Then line 3

This is known as synchronous programming in JavaScript â€” code runs line by line in order.

ðŸ“Œ Real-World Challenges with Synchronous Code
-
In small scripts like the example above, synchronous execution is fine.

But in real-world applications with thousands of lines of code, synchronous programming can become problematic:

If one line takes too long to execute or fails, it can block the entire execution.

This can make your application unresponsive.

ðŸ§© Solution: Asynchronous Programming
-
To solve this, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming â€” allowing code to run in the background while the rest of the application continues to execute.

This keeps your app responsive and efficient, even if some operations take time to complete (like API calls, timers, or file reads).

ðŸ”§ Techniques to Handle Asynchronous Code
-
JavaScript offers three main techniques to handle asynchronous code:

**Callback Functions** â€“ The old-school way using functions passed as arguments.

**Promises** â€“ A modern, cleaner approach to avoid callback hell.

**Async/Await** â€“ Syntactic sugar on top of Promises for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
